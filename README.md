# AI-Driven-Environmental-Monitoring-and-Forecasting-System-Using-Spatiotemporal-Models

Designed and implemented a dual-module AI system to monitor environmental conditions. The project integrates air quality forecasting using CNN+LSTM and ARIMA models with satellite image classification using MobileNet. Achieved 95% classification accuracy and effective AQI prediction using real-time data (PM2.5, NO2, CO). Supports urban planning, public health, and disaster management by delivering timely environmental insights.
